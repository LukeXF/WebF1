		<h3>Week 1</h3>
		<p>
			This week was my first introduction to the HTML coding language. So I
			spent the majority of the week familiarizing myself with the language and learning
			the different characteristics. We also got our virtual machines set up and running.
			This week has been quite challenging for me, as I have never coded before so as a
			result I知 trying to learn two different languages at the same time (HMTL in web
			F1 and python in Introduction to programming).
		</p>
		<h3>Week 2</h3>
		<p>
			This week we looked into CSS style sheets. We learnt about how
			descriptive markup is more preferable because it is easier to maintain and
			produces a smaller sized file. This made me a lot more confident about how I was
			going to style my website. I was getting worked that on each individual page I
			would have to code each individual body of text. But now I know that I can link
			my styles sheets to bodies of text. I知 hoping to have the majority of my style
			sheets completed to basic level by the end of next week so that I don稚 need to
			worry about them as much whilst I知 laying out the rest of my website.
		</p>
		<h3>Week 3</h3>
		<p>
			This week the focus was on our literature reviews rather than on our
			websites. This gave me time to make sure I fulfilled last week痴 aims of getting the
			majority of my CSS style sheets completed. I also read around some different
			topics for my literature review. Currently I知 thinking about basing my literature
			review on how the military use and help fund computer based technologies. But
			so far I have found very little literature that reviews this topic.
		</p>
		<h3>Week 4</h3>
		<p>
			This week the focus was again on our literature reviews. So I知 taking
			this week of my website and my style sheets in order to focus on my literature
			review. I have found a few more pieces of literature to review about the military
			and their involvement with the computing industry, but I do not think this will be
			enough to write my literature review. I have looked through all the sources I have
			found and have created a spider diagram about all of the key areas I will write
			about in my literature review.
		</p>
		<h3>Week 5</h3>
		<p>
			This week it was back to the websites, and we learnt about the various
			different forms of media that are at our disposal (that we can actually use on the
			web). We learnt how to use images in our websites and how we can use image
			aspect ratio too give us different images depending on the size of the web page.
			We also learnt about how CSS styling can be incorporated into our images as well.
		</p>
		<h3>Week 6</h3>
		<p>
			This week I focused mainly on my literature review. I have decided too
			choose a different topic to write about as I can稚 find much material to review and
			write about. Instead of writing about the militaries contribution to the
			sustainability of computing, I have decided to write about what sustainable
			computing actually is. I have already found a number of different sources and feel
			a lot more confident about what I知 going to be writing about.
		</p>
		<h3>Week 7</h3>
		<p>
			This week I drew out a rough page design on paper and listed a couple of
			color scheme ideas. In lectures we looked at design. But I focused mainly on
			getting my literature review finished. I needed to be quick as I took me too long to
			figure out what I was actually going to write about, so I知 quite far behind. I have
			only got the introduction and the conclusion to do.
		</p>
		<h3>Week 8</h3>
		<p>
			my literature review is now finished. I have written all of the content and
			am happy with what I have down. I am now going through and checking all of my
			work and making sure there are no silly mistakes. I have also constructed the
			initial pages on my website. All I have left to do is find the color scheme I like the
			most, add navigation to all pages and other finishing touches. I also still need to
			make my video.
