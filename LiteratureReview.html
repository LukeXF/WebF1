		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>
			In this literature review I will give a definition of sustainable computing and will talk about the
			effects that computers have on the environment, more specifically the atmospheric imbalance that
			is being caused by greenhouse gases that are given off by computers. I also hope to explain some of
			the criteria that should be looked at when trying to buy a green computers. I also hope give some
			information about how the contribution the atmospheric imbalance caused by computers is rising
			due to the increase in numbers, and the amount of power being used in high performance
			computing (HPC).
		</p>
		<h3>Definition of sustainable computing</h3>
		<p>
			Sustainable computing is a concept that looks and the ability to not only maintain the availability and
			quality of computing whilst trying also striving to improve it. Cornell University have defined the
			sustainable computing as being a concept that looks at all aspects of information technologies from
			the amount of energy needed to power machines all the way through to the cost and effect that
			information technologies have on us.
		</p>
		<h3>High performance computing</h3>
		<p>
			High performance computing (HPC) is a form of computing that is used to solve extremely
			complex problems. Examples of just a few areas in which high performance computing
			would be used could include complex simulation systems or systems where big data is being
			handled. Such systems are often used in areas of aeronautical engineering and in many of
			the sciences. In the first chapter of Ali Hursons ‘advances in computers green and
			sustainable computing part 2’ [2] He states that HPC is the solution used when faced with
			hugely difficult computing problems. And that they are used to deal with these problems in
			an acceptable time, making use of some of the quickest systems available at the time. Later
			in the chapter he goes on to talk about how the development in HPC performance in turn
			led to machines that used more power to run.
		</p>
		<h3>How computers and HPC affect the environment</h3>
		<p>
			Computers help to simulate the same effect on the environment as greenhouse gasses. This is very
			bad for the environment especially with computers becoming more and more powerful, and more
			computers being manufactured and used each day. In an extract from [3] The international journal
			of advanced networking applications 2015 Vimal P.Parmar, Apurva K. Pandya and Dr. CK
			Kumbharana talk about how computers are manufactures using a wide range of materials including
			carbon. This carbon is then released or emitted into the atmosphere when a machine runs of
			electricity. This is a big worry as the carbon di-oxide released into the atmosphere imbalances the
			natural gases and thus speeds up the rate of climate change and global warming. There are some
			steps that can be taken to help reduce the amount of pollution and atmospheric imbalance caused
			by computers. For example, you could use old computers as educational tools rather than leaving
			them idol to pollute the environment, whilst not being used. Another good way to help reduce the
			pollution caused by computers is to make sure that they are discarded properly. For example
			batteries contain chemicals which too contain carbon, which can harm the environment.
		</p>
		<h3>Sustainable and green devices</h3>
		<p>
			Green and sustainable devices can be identified by looking at a selection of different criteria’s. In [4]
			Green computing tools and techniques for saving energy, money, and resources / Bud E.
			Smith.(2014).  E. Smith lists the criteria you should look for when considering green devices. For
			example he lists recyclable packaging, the pint being the more recyclable packaging the better for
			the environment it will be. Another factor to consider when looking for the ‘greenest’ device would
			be the power consumed whilst charging the machine compared to the battery life. If you have to use
			a lot of power the charge the machine but it only has a short battery life, then it isn’t particularly
			green because a lot of energy is being wasted. The size of the package and the weight of the
			machine should also be taken into consideration.  The smaller the device/machine is the less
			materials where used and processed during the production phase of the machines life. Making it
			more environmentally friendly. When looking into a green device you need to not only look at the
			device/machine when it is operational, but also need to take into account the production of the
			machine and the ability to safely dispose of the machine after it is no longer required.
		</p>
		<h3>Conclusion</h3>
		<p>
			In conclusion, when talking about sustainable and green computing, you have to be aware that a
			green computer needs to be environmentally friendly long before it is taken out of the packaging
			from the store. You must be aware of the amount of waste products produced during the
			manufacturing process and the shipping process. Other aspects to be considered are things such as
			the packaging methods used. But of course it is still very important that the machine runs efficiently
			and sustainably. For example you need to look into the power efficiency of the machine, and how
			much energy it takes to charge the machine if applicable. These criteria become even more
			important when dealing with high performance computers, as they use far more power (which can
			be wasted), and are often larger than regular machines, and therefore have far more packaging to
			dispose of. With the rapid increase in the power of computers and the number of computers being
			used, the contribution of pollution made by the computing industry to the global atmospheric
			imbalance is only going to grow and grow. Another thing to be considered is the distance a machine
			has to travel from the factory to get to the shelves of the store it is being sold at. Some computers
			make extremely long journeys from the factory and can be shipped right across the world to reach
			the shelves. This has a very big impact on the atmospheric imbalance that is causing global warming,
			and therefore needs to be taken into consideration.
